		<h2>I am a video game enthusiast.</h2>
		<p>The game I've spent the most time playing is Team Fortress 2. The reason I've decided to be a game designer is because video games has surrounded me and entertained me for a decade.

		<p>The reason I chose this field because it relates to game design. This relates to both the interactive abilities of a game and the design of a game. I switched to this major from the information technology major because it interests me less compared to things related to games and my obession to games.</p>
